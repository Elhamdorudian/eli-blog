There is some evidence that mental stimulation is one of the factors that can delay the onset of dementia and reading is among the activities that can help to keep the brain active. It is far from a passive pastime. When we read we create mental simulations of the activities, sights and sounds of scenes in a story, blending these with our own memories and experiences, all of which stimulates the neural pathways. As well as this, research suggests that reading for 30 minutes a week increases health and wellbeing. Reading for pleasure has been found to improve our confidence and self-esteem, providing the grounding we need to pursue our goals and make life decisions. It can also aid our sleep and reduce feelings of loneliness. To the onlooker, reading can appear to be a solitary and passive activity.

I started learning how to swim when I was five years old and I have been swimming ever since.There are many reasons why I love swimming but I\u2019ll just share a few with you, and maybe I can even encourage you to go for a swim. The first reason that I love swimming is that it can be extremely relaxing. I love the feeling of floating on the water and feeling almost weightless. I find that whenever I leave the pool I feel totally relaxed. On the other hand, it can also be a fast-paced competitive sport which raises your heartbeat. It\u2019s amazing pushing yourself to the challenge of beating someone else to the finish line and it\u2019s great fun racing across the pool as fast as you can! Trying little tricks like underwater handstands and flips also puts a big smile on my face. Another reason that I love swimming is that it has more variety than other sports. Swimming offers many different strokes, so it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re stuck doing the same thing over and over again. Adding swimming equipment like flippers, a snorkel or a noodle (a flexible cylindrical piece of foam) changes the experience yet again and can help you develop your swimming technique. In the summer, swimming provides a nice, refreshing break! There\u2019s nothing better than jumping into the water on a hot, sweltering summer\u2019s day. The pool makes you feel instantly better. And I think it adds to the summer holiday feeling, as for me the summer months are when I swim the most. It is a sport which can be done all over the world in many beautiful locations. You can choose to swim in a swimming pool or to go splash in the sea. And finally, it\u2019s a life skill which everyone should have.
